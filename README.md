# shortyURL
A tiny project demonstrating a custom URL shortener.

This is a proof-of-concept: it "doesn't work", as this software only operates offline. This means that generated URLs are valid but if put in a regular browser they won't lead to any website, because there isn't a server who can handle the request.
